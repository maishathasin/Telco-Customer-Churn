# Statement of Contributions
Both Maisha and Joseph searched for and selected the dataset. Both members contributed to the initial investigation and dataset preprocessing. Maisha performed the exploratory data analysis and trained the Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbour classifiers. Joseph drafted the report and trained the Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network classifiers. Both members made significant revisions and additions to the report over many rounds.
