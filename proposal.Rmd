## Dataset

The Telco Customer Churn datset, provided by IBM, contains information about a fictional telecommunications (telco) company which provided home phone and internet services to 7043 customers. The dataset provides demographic and business-related metrics for each customer, as well as identifying whether the customer switched providers (customer churn).

The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: <https://accelerator.ca.analytics.ibm.com/bi/?perspective=authoring&pathRef=.public_folders%2FIBM%2BAccelerator%2BCatalog%2FContent%2FDAT00067>

The dataset contains 33 variables for 7043 observations, but not all variables are fit to be predictive features. We removed columns relating to unique IDs, geographical information, and dashboarding aggregation, as well as "duplicate" columns (those that are identical to another column except for formatting), and columns related to the response (such as the churn reason and predicted lifetime value to the company).

We are then left with 19 features, listed below. The descriptions of the features are adapted from <https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113>:
